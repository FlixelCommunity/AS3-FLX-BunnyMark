### About FlxBunnyMark and BunnyMark

The FlxBunnyMark was written to compare [AS3 Flixel](https://github.com/AdamAtomic/flixel) with [HaxeFlixel](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel). The initial BunnyMark was [created by Iain Lobb](http://blog.iainlobb.com/2010/11/display-list-vs-blitting-results.html) (code) and [Amanda Lobb](http://amandalobb.com/) (art), then ported to haxe-NME by [Joshua Granick](http://www.joshuagranick.com/blog/?p=508), then enhanced by [Philippe Elsass](https://github.com/elsassph/nme-bunnymark.), now ported to HaxeFlixel by [BeebleRox](https://github.com/Beeblerox), and improved by [impaler ](https://github.com/impaler) and [Gama11](https://github.com/Gama11), ported to AS3 by [impaler](https://github.com/impaler).
